# PPL_Interpreter
Designed and implemented a custom instruction set architecture (ISA) and interpreter in C++11, using object-oriented polymorphism to model executable instructions.

All of the PPL interpreter code is located in main.cpp.

The PPL test files show some example instruction sets that are supported by the interpreter.
